These type of devices are part of the \"quantified self\" movement -- a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. But these data remain under-utilized both because the raw data are hard to obtain and there is a lack of statistical methods and software for processing and interpreting the data.\n\nThis assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day\n\n## Loading and preprocessing the data\n\nReading the .csv file into \"data\" dataset.\n\n```{r}\ndata_csv <- read.csv(file=\"activity.csv\")\n# deleting Na values\ndata <- data_csv[!is.na(data_csv$steps),]\nsummary(data)\n\n```\n\n\n\n## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?\nCalculating the total steps per day\n```{r}\nrequire(plyr)\nsteps <- ddply(data,.(date),summarize,total = sum(steps))\n\n```\n\n1. histogram of the total number of steps taken each day\n```{r}\nhist(steps$total, col= \"red\",main = \"Histogram total steps each day\", xlab= \"Steps each day\")\n```\n\n2.  The mean and median total number of steps taken per day\n\n```{r}\n#Calculating the mean\nmean(steps$total)\n#Calculating the median\nmedian(steps$total)\n```\n\n\n## What is the average daily activity pattern?\n```{r}\n#Calculating the mean activity per day\nactivity <- ddply(data,.(interval),summarize,steps = mean(steps))\n```\n\n\n1. Series plot  of the 5-minute interval and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days\n\n```{r}\nplot(activity$interval,activity$steps, type = \"l\", \n     col = \"blue\", main = \"Daily activity pattern\", \n     xlab = \"5-minute interval\", ylab=\"averaged steps taken\")\n```\n\n2. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?\n\n```{r}\nactivity[activity$steps == max(activity$steps),]\n```\n\n\n## Imputing missing values\n1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset \n```{r}\nna_values <- data_csv[is.na(data_csv$steps),]\nnrow(na_values)\n```\n\n2. Filling in all of the missing values in the dataset\nStrategy: fill the missing value with the mean of steps taken in the same 5-minute interval (from \"activity\" dataset).\n\n```{r}\ndataNoNA <- data_csv \nrows <- as.numeric(nrow(data_csv))\nfor(i in 1:rows) {\n        if(is.na(data_csv[i,1])) {\n                dataNoNA[i,1] <- activity[activity$interval == dataNoNA[i,3],2]\n        }\n}\n\n```\n\n3. Creating new dataset named dataNoNA.\n```{r}\nsummary(dataNoNA)\n```\n\n4. Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day\n\n```{r}\nsteps2 <- ddply(dataNoNA,.(date),summarize,total = sum(steps))\nhist(steps2$total, col= \"red\",main = \"Histogram total steps each day\", xlab= \"Steps each day\")\n\n#Calculating the mean\nmean(steps2$total)\n#Calculating the median\nmedian(steps2$total)\n```\n\ncomparing with the previous result:\n2.  The mean and median total number of steps taken per day\n\n```{r}\n#Previous Mean\nmean(steps$total)\n#Previous  median\nmedian(steps$total)\n```\n\n## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?\n1. Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels -- \"weekday\" and \"weekend\" indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.\n```{r}\ndataNoNA$day <- weekdays(as.Date(dataNoNA$date))\nrows <- as.numeric(nrow(dataNoNA))\nfor(i in 1:rows) {\n        if((dataNoNA[i,4] == \"sábado\") | (dataNoNA[i,4] == \"domingo\")) {\n            dataNoNA[i,4] <- \"weekend\"\n        }\n        else{\n            dataNoNA[i,4] <- \"weekday\"\n        }\n}\ndataNoNA$day <- as.factor(dataNoNA$day)\n\n\n```\n\n\n2. Plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = \"l\") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis).\n```{r fig.height= 10}\n#Calculating the mean activity per day\nactivity <- ddply(dataNoNA,.(day,interval),summarize,steps = mean(steps))\n\npar(mfrow = c(2, 1))\n\n#plotting weekday activity\nwith(subset(activity,day == \"weekday\"),\nplot(interval,steps, type = \"l\", \n     col = \"blue\", main = \"weekday activity pattern\", \n     xlab = \"5-minute interval\", ylab=\"averaged steps taken\"))\n\n#plotting weekend activity\nwith(subset(activity,day == \"weekend\"),\nplot(interval,steps, type = \"l\", \n     col = \"blue\", main = \"weekend activity pattern\", \n     xlab = \"5-minute interval\", ylab=\"averaged steps taken\")) \n\n```",
